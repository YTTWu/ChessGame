## Project Description

 Why is it important or interesting to you?
  Chess is interesting due to many factors, one being that it is a complex game that requires analytical and strategic thinking. This is similar to programming which also requires logical thinking and evaluation of all moves which can affect the entire process. There are many possible combinations and strategies to play a game of chess and likewise in programming there are various ways to create a program. 
  
 What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? 
 C++, hammer. 
 
 What will be the input/output of your project?
  Input: Two users will each take turns on deciding where to move their individual chess pieces on the game board by using algebraic notation.   
  Output: Each player's moves and which coordinates their pieces move to will be displayed in the program.  Once the game is won by one of the two players,the player's name will be displayed as the winner. 
  *There will be no visual game board; the moves will be made using algebraic notation. 
  
 What are the two design patterns you will be using? For each design pattern you must explain in 4-5 sentences:
 1. Composite
   We picked this pattern because we will have a collection of objects that we want to treat the same. Each piece will inherent from an abstract class with the basic components of a chess piece. A challenge we might encounter that can be resolved by using the composite pattern is building each piece's function. Then we will build an individual class for each type of piece, with unique functions and restriction. 
  
 2. Strategy 
  We picked this pattern to define each piece's movement since strategy patterns are used to manage algorithms and relationships between objects. Each individual piece will have its own move function implemenetation that is unique to it. A problem we will anticipate is making each piece move how its supposed to. To solve this, we will have a base abstract class which all classes can extend and have their own move implementations. 
 

 > ## Phase II
 > In addition to completing the "Class Diagram" section below, you will need to 
 > * Set up your GitHub project board as a Kanban board for the project. It should have columns that map roughly to 
 >   * Backlog, TODO, In progress, In testing, Done
 >   * You can change these or add more if you'd like, but we should be able to identify at least these.
 > * There is no requirement for automation in the project board but feel free to explore those options.
 > * Create an "Epic" (note) for each feature and each design pattern and assign them to the appropriate team member. Place these in the `Backlog` column
 > * Complete your first *sprint planning* meeting to plan out the next 7 days of work.
 >   * Create smaller development tasks as issues and assign them to team members. Place these in the `Backlog` column.
 >   * These cards should represent roughly 7 days worth of development time for your team, taking you until your first meeting with the TA
## Class Diagram
 > Include a class diagram(s) for each design pattern and a description of the diagram(s). Your class diagram(s) should include all the main classes you plan for the project. This should be in sufficient detail that another group could pick up the project this point and successfully complete it. Use proper OMT notation (as discussed in the course slides). You may combine multiple design patterns into one diagram if you'd like, but it needs to be clear which portion of the diagram represents which design pattern (either in the diagram or in the description). 
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in with the TA (during lab hours or office hours). Your entire team must be present. 
 > * Before the meeting you should perform a sprint plan like you did in Phase II
 > * In the meeting with your TA you will discuss: 
 >   - How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 >   - Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 >   - Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 >   - What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the TA during lab time. The TA will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Kanban board. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
